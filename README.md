# Teams-Attendance-Bot

Java application, which takes the login details and class details of a user, and stores this information.
The program then minimizes itself, and runs in the background. At the time of a class, the application automatically opens MS Teams on a browser and logins using the details provided by the user. It then navigates to the given team, and joins the running meeting. 
The application, will leave a meeting based on the leave condition specified.
Once a class is completed, the application will still run in background, waiting for the time of the remaining classes of the user.
